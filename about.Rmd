## Exploratory Data Analysis

The most notable finding from the exploratory data analysis phase was that suicide rates have been going up over time on average across all counties in Massachusetts.

  scale_color_discrete("County") +
  ggtitle("Year vs. Years of Potential Life Lost to Suicide (YPLL)")

ggplotly(my_graph)
```

Additionally, we see that neither unemployment rates nor opioid dispensing rates show a strong or significant bivariate relationship with suicide rates by county. 

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
my_plot_2 <- train_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = unemployment_rate, y = ypll_age_adjusted_rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = county)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous("Unemployment Rate") +
  scale_y_continuous("YPLL Age-Adjusted Rate") +
  scale_color_discrete("County") +
  ggtitle("Unemployment Rate vs. Years of Potential Life Lost to Suicide")

ggplotly(my_plot_2)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
my_plot_3 <- train_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = opioid_dispensing_rate_per_100, y = ypll_age_adjusted_rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = county)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous("Opioid Dispensing Rate Per 100") +
  scale_y_continuous("YPLL Age-Adjusted Rate") +
  scale_color_discrete("County") +
  ggtitle("Opioid Dispensing Rate vs. Years of Potential Life Lost to Suicide")

ggplotly(my_plot_3)
```

## Regression Analysis

The initial linear model, which looked at the relationship between years of potential life lost to suicide and opioid dispensing rate, unemployment rate, year and county, had an R2 of 0.34 and an adjusted R2 of 0.28. This is a relatively low R2 value. The main predictors of suicide rate appear to be year and county.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(jtools)
library(sjPlot)
library(sjmisc)
library(sjlabelled)

basic_model_on_train_data <- lm(ypll_age_adjusted_rate ~ unemployment_rate + year + opioid_dispensing_rate_per_100 + county, data = train_data)

 ## https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jtools/vignettes/summ.html
  basic_model_on_train_data %>%
    tab_model()
```

## Prediction

Finally, I attempted both linear and random forest models with 10-fold cross validation to predict suicide rates using the same covariates employed in the model. Final predictions are displayed to the right of the black line. 

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
my_plot_4 <- train_data %>%
  select(county, ypll_age_adjusted_rate, year) %>%
  rbind(final_predictions) %>%
  mutate(alpha_ = ifelse(year == 2020, 0, 1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = ypll_age_adjusted_rate, color = county, alpha = alpha_)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_alpha_binned(range = c(0.25,1)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2019.5) +
    scale_x_continuous("Year", breaks = c(2001, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020)) +
  scale_y_continuous("YPLL to Suicide\nAge-Adjusted Rate") +
  scale_color_discrete("County") +
  ggtitle("Year vs. Years of Potential Life Lost to Suicide (YPLL)")

ggplotly(my_plot_4)
